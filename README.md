# Smart Waste Sorting System: Automated Segregation of Metals, Glass, and Organics with Sensors

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Smart Waste Sorting System using Arduino. The system is designed to automatically segregate waste into three categories: metals, glass, and organic materials, using various sensors. The goal is to create a sustainable and technology-driven approach to improve waste management efficiency, reduce human error, and promote recycling.

## Features

- Automatic waste segregation into metals, glass, and organic materials
- Utilizes ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement
- Incorporates various sensors for material recognition
- Servo motors for bin actuation
- Real-time data processing using Arduino microcontroller
- User-friendly design and low-cost implementation
- Adaptable for integration into existing waste management systems
